- SQL Workshop:
  * Object browser: tables
  * SQL commands: test a few queries:
    --
    select name
    ,      the_date
    ,      total_distance
    from   events;
    --
    select first_name
    ,      last_name
    ,      team_name
    ,      gender
    ,      date_of_birth
    ,      floor
            ((sysdate - date_of_birth)/365) as age
    from   runners;
    --
    select r.first_name
    ,      r.last_name
    ,      r.gender
    ,      r.team_name
    ,      e.name as event_name
    ,      e.total_distance
    ,      er.start_time
    ,      er.end_time
    from   runners r
    join   event_results er on r.id = er.runner_id
    join   events e on e.id = er.event_id;
    --

Lets extend our app
- SQL Workshop --> Utilities --> Quick SQL:
  # auditcols: true
  # drop     : true
  volunteers
    first_name /nn
    last_name  /nn
    date_of_birth /nn
    gender vc1 /nn
    email
    phone
    duties vc100
  
- Save script
- Review and run


-Check if your table has been created
* with object browser
* with sql script
Try an insert:
--
  INSERT INTO volunteers (
    first_name,
    last_name,
    date_of_birth,
    gender
  ) VALUES (
    'John',
    'Doe',
    '13-DEC-1984',
    'M'
  );
-- in sql workshop:
select * 
from   volunteers;
--
