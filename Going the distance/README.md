# Going the distance

This is a repository of my third workshop at Qualogy Caribbean. It's divided into 4 parts and each part has its own set of instructions and a downloadable app, so you can continue with the next part if you were not finished with the previous one.
In this workshop you will be developing an application where racing events can be managed. After the workshop you will be able to add,
edit or delete runners, events and results to the database and also run some pretty graphs and reports.

## Warming Up.
Get to know the APEX application builder, terminology, basic functionality and develop some pages by coding along with the trainer.

## And we're off!
Build your own basic CRUD pages. Add navigation and learn to use shared components.

## Break
Get some well deserved rest and grab some food for much needed energy for the next module.

## Hitting your stride.
Add some data validations, more advanced reports and logic.

## The home stretch.
Add client side behaviour to your pages.

## Cooldown
Questions, Drinks and Networking
