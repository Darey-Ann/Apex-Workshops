Start building basic standard pages: reports and form
We will use Apex to generate some reports and forms
Section A: Classic reports and modal forms

1. Create a classic report and modal form on table "OEHR_DEPARTMENTS"
  a. Click on Create Page and choose "Form" and then "Report with Form on Table", click next
  b. Report Type = Classic Report
     Report Page Name = Departments
     Form Page Name = Department
     Form Page Mode = Modal Dialog
     Click Next
  c. Create a new navigation entry: Departments with no parent selected
     Click Next
  d. Choose Table name = OEHR_DEPARTMENTS, all columns should be included, click Next
  e. Select all Columns to be shown included in Form
     Select Primary Key Column = DEPARTMENT_ID
     Source for PK = Existing Trigger
     Click Create
  f. Run this report page (Play button in app builder)
  g. Test the Form page (insert/update/delete)

2. Customize/Edit the report page: Navigate to the page and click on "edit page"
  a. change the report title to Departments
  b. change column "department id"
    i.   change heading to Location, instead of Location id
    ii.  change Type from "Plain Text" to "Plain Text (Based on List of Values)"
    iii. for List Of Values enter:
         Type = SQL Query
         SQL Query = select street_address||', '||city as display
                     ,      location_id                as return
                     from   oehr_locations
  c. change column "manager id" in the same way but use Query
     select last_name||', '||first_name d
     ,      employee_id                 r
     from   oehr_employees
  d. change the button position of the create button to "Edit"
  e. change the report Attributes of this report:
     Appearance --> Template options --> Stretch Report

3. Add Search Functionality to report page
  a. Add an item to region "Departments": right mouse click on region in app builder
     Name = P<XX>_SEARCH_DEP_NAME  (the xx will be your page number)
     Type = Text Field
     Label = Search Department Name
     Template = Optional - Floating
     Icon = fa-search
     Submit when enter pressed = Yes
  b. Edit Source for Region Departments, SQL Query =

         DEPARTMENT_NAME,
         MANAGER_ID,
         LOCATION_ID
  from OEHR_DEPARTMENTS
  where instr(department_name,:P<XX>_SEARCH_DEP_NAME) > 0
  or    :P11_SEARCH_DEP_NAME is null
  c. Save, Run and test page.
  d. **Optional: Add clear search button: right mouse click on region buttons
     i.  Button Name = CLEAR
         Action = Submit Page
     ii. Create a proces: right mouse click on processing
         Name = CLEAR SEARCH

                  from   oehr_employees
   d. click Create
2. Do the same for oehr_locations
   name = location_name_return_id
   SQL Query = select street_address||', '||city as display
               ,      location_id                as return
               from   oehr_locations
